What Economics is about
- "The one who manages the household"
- The study of how society manages its scarce resources
- What kinds of questions does economics address?
    - How do people decide how much to work, and what to buy
    - How firms decide how many workers to hire and how much to produce
    - How society decides how to divide its resources between national defence and consumer goods (guns vs. butter); protecting the environment and other needs
Ten principles of Economics
1. People face trade-offs.  All decisions involve trade-offs.
	- Going to a party the night before an exam
	- Having more money to buy stuff
		- More time working, less time for leisure
	- Protecting the environment
		- Locks up resources
	Society fares an important trade-off: efficiency vs. equality.
		Efficiency: society gets the most it can from scarce resources
		Equality: society distributes uniformly amongst the members
	Trade-off:  To achieve greater equality we could redistribute income from wealthy to poor.  But this reduces the incentive to work and produce, shrinks the size of the economic 'pie'.
2. The cost of something is what you give up to get it.
	- Making decisions requires comparing the costs and benefits of alternative choices. (Cost-benefit analysis)
	- Opportunity cost of any item is whatever must be given up to get it
		"There is no free lunch"
		The relevant cost for decision making
	- Going to college
		tuition, foregone wages, books, fees
	- Seeing a movie
		time, ticket
3. Rational people think at the margin.
	Rational people: systematically and deliberately do the best they can to achieve their objectives.
	Marginal changes: Small, incremental adjustments to an existing plan of action
4. People respond to incentives.
	Incentive: something that induces a person to act, the prospect of reward/punishment
	- Rational people respond
	- Gas prices relates to hybrid car/SUV sales
