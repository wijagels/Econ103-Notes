The economist as a scientist and policy advisor
	- As scientists, economists make positive statements, which attempt to describe how the world is.
		Positive statements can be confirmed or refuted by examining evidence.
	- As policy advisors, economists make normative statements which attempt to prescribe how the world should be.
		Normative statements can not be confirmed or refuted, it always involves value judgment.  A good or bad policy is not just a matter of science, it also involves our views on ethics, religion, and political philosophy.
	Ex. Minimum wage laws cause unemployment. (positive)
	Ex. The government should raise the minimum wage.  (normative)
	Ex. Prices rise when the government increases the quantity of money.  (positive)
	Ex. The government should print less money.  (normative)
	Ex. A tax cut is needed to stimulate the economy.  (normative)
	Ex. An increase in the price of burritos will cause an increase in consumer demand for music downloads.  (positive)
	Positive and normative statements are fundamentally different, but they are often intertwined with a person's set of beliefs.
	Ex. Printing too much money causes inflation.  (positive)  The government should print less money.  (normative)
