9. Prices rise when the government prints too much money
	Inflation: an increase in the overall level of prices in the economy
	In the long run, inflation is always caused by excessive growth in the quantity of money, which causes the value of money to fall.
	The faster the government creates money, the greater the inflation rate.
10. Society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment
	- In the short run (1-2 years), many economics policies push inflation and unemployment in opposite directions.
	- The short-run trade-off plays a key role in the analysis of business cycle -- the irregular and largely unpredictable fluctuation in economic activity, such as employment and production.
	
How does money flow through markets?
	- There are two types of "subjects":
		1. Firms
		2. Households
	- There are two markets:
		1. The goods & services market
		2. The factors of production market
			- The resources that firms use to produce goods and services
				- Labor, land, capital (buildings, plants, machines used for production)
	- Firms:
		- Hire and use factors of production
		- Produce goods & services
	- Households:
		- Buy goods and services
		- Own the factors of production, sell or rent them to firms
