How is CPI calculated? (5 steps)
	1. Fix the "basket".  The bureau of labor statistics (BLS) surveys consumers to determine what is in a typical consumer's "shopping basket".
	2. Find the prices.  The BLS collects data on the prices of all the goods in the basket.
	3. Compute the basket's cost.  Use the prices to compute the total cost of the basket.
