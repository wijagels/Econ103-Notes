- In the Mustang repair scenario, the $1000 you spent on repairs is irrelevant.  What matters is the cost vs benefit of the marginal repair.
- Sunk cost: a past cost that has already occurred and can't be recovered.

5. Three Principles of how People Interact
Trade can make everyone better off
    - Rather than being self-sufficient, people can specialize in producing one good or service and exchange it for other goods.
    - Countries benefit from trade and specialization:
        1. Get a better price abroad for goods they produce
        2. Buy other goods more cheaply from abroad than could be produced at home
6. Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity.
    What goods to produce
    How to produce them
    How much of each to produce
    Who gets them
	- A market economy: allocates resources through the decentralized decisions of many households and firms as they interact in markets for goods and services.
	- A planned economy is one that is heavily regulated or controlled by the government, most notably in socialist or communist countries.
	- The invisible hand* works through the price system:
		- The interaction of buyers and sellers determine prices
		- Each price reflects the goods value to buyers, and cost of producing the goods to the sellers
		- Prices guide self-interested households and firms to make decisions that in many cases, maximize society's economic well-being
7. Governments can sometimes improve market outcomes
    - Important role for government: enforce property rights
    - People are less inclined to work, produce, invest, or purchase if large risk of their property being stolen
    Ex. restaurant will not serve meals if customers do not pay before they leave
    Ex. musical company won't produce music if people steal it
    - Market failure: when the market fails to allocate society's resources efficiently
        1. Externalities: when the production or consumption of a good affects bystanders
        2. Market Power: a single buyer or seller has substantial influence on market prices
		- Public policies may promote efficiency/equality.
		- If the market's distribution of economic well-being is not desirable, tax or welfare policies can change how the economic 'pie' is divided.
8. A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services
	- Huge variation in living standards across countries and over time
	- The most important determinant of living standards is productivity, the amount of goods and services per unit of labor
	- Productivity depends on the equipment, skills, and technology available to workers.  Also depends on other factors such as labor unions or international competition.  Less impact on living standards

Famous insight by Adam Smith in the Wealth of Nations (1776)
    Each of these households and firms acts as "led by an invisible hand" to promote general economic well-being.
