Advantage
	- If each country has an absolute advantage in one good and specializes in that good, then both countries can gain from trade.
	- Producing one ton of wheat uses 10 labor hours in US vs 25 in Japan, US has an absolute advantage in Wheat Industry
	- Producing one computer requires 125 labor hours in Japan but only 100 in US, US has an absolute advantage in Computer Industry
	Why does Japan specialize in computers?
	Why do both countries gain from trade?
		Comparative advantage: Ability to produce a good at a lower cost than another producer
		Gains from trade arise from comparative advantage differences in opportunity costs
		Comparative advantage means being able to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost.  Absolute advantage means being able to produce a good with fewer inputs
		When each country specializes in the goods in which it has a comparative advantage, total production in all countries is higher, the world's economic pie is bigger and all countries can gain from trade.
		The same applies to individual producers like the farmer and rancher specializing in different goods and trading with each other.
Supply & Demand
	- What factors affect buyer demand for goods?
	- What factors affect seller supply of goods?
	- How do supply and demand determine the price of a good and the quantity sold?
	- How do changes in the factors that affect demand or supply affect the market price and quantity of goods?
	- How do markets allocate resources?
	Markets and Competition:
		- A market: A group of buyers and sellers of a particular product
		- A competitive market: A market with many buyers and sellers, each having a negligible effect on price.
		- A perfectly competitive market:
			1. All goods exactly the same
			2. Buyers and sellers are so numerous that no one can affect the market price
